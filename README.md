# clock
Simple javascript clock inspired by a query to a Bing LLM


# Tournament Edition

Show the current tournament, what events are currently happening, and what pistes...
- requires a server side piece that connects to database with the tournament information
- ! should pass this "server address" to the app through the URL so the code can be public.
- ! Run the API server on the same machine as check-in
- If no URL or no data just show the nice big clock.
- if tournament running then show smaller clock and events for that day, timing, and pistes etc..
